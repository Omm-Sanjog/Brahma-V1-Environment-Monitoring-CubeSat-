## Overview
Brahma-V1 is a compact satellite-inspired telemetry and communication system built using a **distributed computing architecture**. The project uses three **Arduino Nano** boards working together to simulate the functionality of a CubeSat:

### Onboard Subsystems (Satellite Unit)
- **Nano-1:** Sensor data acquisition
- **Nano-2:** Data processing and LoRa transmission

### Ground Station
- **Nano-3:** Receiving LoRa packets and forwarding them to a computer
- **Python-based dashboard:** Displays real-time telemetry, plots sensor data, monitors system health, and shows communication statistics.

This project is designed for academic, research, and competition settings where low-cost satellite simulation is required.

## System Architecture

### 1. Satellite Unit (Onboard Module)

**Nano-1 — Sensor Acquisition Unit**
- Collects sensor payload data (temperature, humidity, pressure, light, etc.)
- Performs basic validation and filtering
- Transfers formatted telemetry frames to Nano-2 via **Serial/I²C**

**Nano-2 — Communication & Processing Unit**
- Receives telemetry packets from Nano-1
- Appends metadata (timestamps, packet ID, health flags)
- Transmits packets over **LoRa SX1278 (RA-02)**
- Handles retransmission logic and radio state management

*This design mimics real satellite subsystems such as OBC, Payload, and Radio.*

### 2. Ground Station (Receiver Module)

**Nano-3 — LoRa Ground Receiver**
- Listens for incoming LoRa packets
- Sends decoded telemetry to the computer over **USB serial**
- Feeds data to a Python dashboard for **real-time plotting and display**

*Acts as the mission control base station.*

## 🌐 Communication Flow

The data path from sensor acquisition to the ground station dashboard.

| Stage | Unit / Protocol | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Acquisition** | [Sensors] | Collects raw environmental and inertial data. |
| **Inter-Nano Transfer** | Arduino Nano 1 (Sensor) $\xrightarrow{\text{Serial/I²C}}$ Arduino Nano 2 (LoRa) | Sensor data is validated and handed off for transmission. |
| **Radio Link** | Arduino Nano 2 $\xrightarrow{\text{LoRa SX1278}}$ Arduino Nano 3 | Packets are transmitted over a long-range, low-power radio link. |
| **Ground Link** | Arduino Nano 3 $\xrightarrow{\text{USB Serial}}$ [Ground Station PC] | Decoded telemetry is forwarded to the computer. |
| **Visualization** | [Ground Station MATLAB Dashboard (Data Plot & Display)] | The data is displayed, plotted, and analyzed in real-time. |
