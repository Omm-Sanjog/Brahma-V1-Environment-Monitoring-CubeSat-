1. Hardware Connection
The first step is establishing the physical link between your sensor system and the laptop.

Connect the Receiver: Use a USB cable to plug your Arduino/ESP32 LoRa receiver into your laptop.

Verify Data Flow: Ensure the LoRa receiver is actively running, is receiving data from your LoRa sensor node, and is outputting the sensor data to its serial port.

2. MATLAB Configuration
Next, configure the MATLAB script to communicate with the correct port.

Identify COM Port: Determine the COM port number (e.g., COM5 on Windows, or /dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux/Mac) that your operating system assigned to the connected LoRa receiver.

Edit the Script: Open the MATLAB script and navigate to the configuration section.

Update Port Name: Change the value of the port variable to match the COM port you identified.

Example: Change port = "COM5"; to your specific port.

Baud Rate: Confirm the script is set to the required baud rate (the provided script uses baud = 9600).

3. Run and Visualize
The final stage involves executing the script to begin data monitoring.

Start the Script: Run the MATLAB script within the MATLAB environment.

Confirm Connection: The MATLAB command window should display the message: "Listening for JSON data from LoRa receiver..."

Observe the Dashboard: A figure window titled "LoRa Sensor Dashboard" will open, showing a 3x3 tiled layout of plots.

Real-Time Plotting: As the script reads, decodes, and processes incoming JSON data, the following nine plots will update automatically in real-time:

Gas Sensors: MQ-8, MQ-2, MQ-9, MQ-7

Environmental: Temperature, Humidity, Pressure

Inertial (IMU): Accelerometer Magnitude, Gyroscope Magnitude
